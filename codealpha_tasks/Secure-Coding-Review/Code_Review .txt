Application Overview
The reviewed application is a Python-based user authentication system that uses a SQLite database.
The purpose of this review is to identify security vulnerabilities caused by insecure coding practices and to recommend secure alternatives.

Review Methodology
The review was conducted using manual source code inspection.
Common insecure coding patterns were identified and mapped to known security risks.

Identified Security Vulnerabilities

1. SQL Injection

Description: User input is directly concatenated into SQL queries.
Impact: An attacker can manipulate database queries to bypass authentication or extract sensitive data.
Severity: High


2. Plaintext Password Handling

Description: Passwords are stored and processed in plaintext.
Impact: If the database or source code is compromised, user credentials are fully exposed.
Severity: High


3. Lack of Input Validation

Description: User input is not validated or sanitized before being processed.
Impact: Increases the risk of injection attacks and logic manipulation.
Severity: Medium


4. Weak Database Design

Description: The database schema does not enforce constraints such as unique usernames.
Impact: Can result in duplicate accounts and inconsistent authentication behavior.
Severity: Low


Security Recommendations

Use parameterized SQL queries to prevent injection attacks.
Hash passwords using secure cryptographic algorithms.
Avoid storing or comparing plaintext credentials.
Apply proper database constraints and secure authentication controls.


Remediation Summary

A secure version of the application was implemented using:
Parameterized queries
Password hashing
Improved database design
These changes mitigate the identified vulnerabilities.

Conclusion
This secure coding review demonstrates how common vulnerabilities arise from insecure coding practices and how they can be mitigated by following secure development principles.
